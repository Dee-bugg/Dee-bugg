# Hi there, I'm Dee!<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/mGcNjsfWAjY5AEZNw6/giphy.gif" width="50"></h2>

**I am currently a full stack engineer specializing in JavaScript and the NERP stack, who is also always looking to explore new technologies.**


#### Here's a little about me üòú

> After graduating with a bachelors in biology I always found myself thinking back to my first computer science course. I was really intrigued how my lines of HTML came together to built a website. My eagerness to further enhance my skills led me to enroll in a Python and Java course at my community college. Those introductory learning experiences to code, further reinforced my desire to become a software engineer.
So I decided to take the plunge into the wonderous world of software engineering an couldn't love it more! I am now excited to enter the tech world with my new found knowledge and I could not be more thrilled.
